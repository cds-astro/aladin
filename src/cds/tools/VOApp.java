/**
 * Interface between two Virtual Observatory applications, such as
 * Aladin (CDS), VOPlot( VO-India), TOPcat, APT (STScI) to exchange data and
 * have an object selection mechanism.
 * This interface is totally symmetrical, it has to be implemented in both applications
 * 
 * NOTA: This interface is based on a previous version called ExtApp but as some methods
 * have been modified, VOApp do not extend ExtApp but reimplements its methods. ExtApp is deprecated.
