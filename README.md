Aladin is an interactive sky atlas allowing the user to visualize digitized astronomical images or full surveys, superimpose entries from astronomical catalogues or databases, and interactively access related data and information from the Simbad database, the VizieR service and other archives for all known astronomical objects in the field. 

The Aladin sky atlas is developed and maintained at [CDS, Strasbourg astronomical data center](https://cds.unistra.fr/). It is available in two modes:
- **Aladin Desktop** , a regular Desktop application (this distribution)
- **Aladin Lite** a Web application (also available on [Github/cds-astro/aladin-lite](https://github.com/cds-astro/aladin-lite))
